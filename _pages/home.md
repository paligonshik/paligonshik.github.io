# Background
---
I am a second-year Data Science master's student  at Rochester Institute of Technology, honorary recipient of the Fulbright Foreign Student Scholarship Grant.

My capstone porject is Just in Time Prediction of Unknown Classes is supervised by Professor [Abu Islam](https://www.rit.edu/sustainabilityinstitute/directory/asigis-abu-islam)  where my objective is to build N-way shot learning with Siemase Network to predict unkown classes not seen in training time. <br> I also work with Professor [Shanchieh Yang](https://www.rit.edu/directory/sjyeec-shanchieh-yang) on exploring the intersection of machine learning and cybersecurity, specifically addressing the issue of imbalanced data in intrusion detection systems and proposing solutions to improve their performance.
Additionally, I am a member in the [Computational Linguistics and Speech Processing Lab (CLaSP)](https://www.rit.edu/clasp/) leaded by Professor [Cecillia O. Alm](https://www.rit.edu/directory/coagla-cecilia-alm).
